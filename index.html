            <pre>  This is a sketch of the interface for a rice cooker. It is comprised of a series of
  buttons and a small screen that tells the time when not displaying the output of a button
  push. Using the buttons and display on the screen the user can choose from several options
  of how to cook their rice depending on what they are putting into the machine and how long
  they want it to cook for.</pre>

                  Observations

                  - Seemed confident when operating 
                  - Immediately directed their attention to the screen over the buttons
                  - Pressed multiple buttons to see the results on the screen as if they were exploring the options but not entering in a specific cooking sequence

                  - Were there any buttons that you noticed first? If so, why?

                  - Were there any buttons or labels that seemed confusing?
                    - I found it surprising that the menu button is small even though thats a key component

                    - I felt comfortable with the red color for cook and the orange color for keep warm because it followed the standard that Im used to for these things

                    pushed buttons in a faster sequence.
